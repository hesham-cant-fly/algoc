#+title: Cross platform interpreter

** Introduction
If you're Moroccan and have started learning any IT-related topic at university or OFPPT, you've probably come across a programming language called =Algo=. This language is primarily available on Android, which can be quite limiting. As a student myself, I decided to create a cross-platform interpreter for it to make it more accessible!


** Installation
Currently, the only way to try Algo is by building it yourself. To get started, install the Zig compiler and run the command =zig build run=. Once you've done that, you're all set!

** Editor support
*** neovim
using lazyvim
#+begin_src lua
{
  "hesham-cant-fly/algo.nvim",
  opts = {}
}
#+end_src

*** Emacs
Soon...

*** vs code
